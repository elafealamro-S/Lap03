# Lab 03 – Selection Statements

## 1. Objective
The purpose of this lab is to familiarize students with:
1. Boolean expressions
2. Simple selection statements in Java
3. Generating random numbers

## 2. Lab Learning Outcomes (LLO)
By completing this lab, students should be able to:
1. Evaluate Boolean expressions
2. Write simple `if` and `if-else` statements in Java
3. Generate random numbers using `Math.random()`

## 3. Theory Review – Selection Statements and Math.random
### If-Else Statement Syntax
```java
if (x >= 60 && x <= 100) {
